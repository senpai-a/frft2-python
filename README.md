# frft2-python
discrete 1d and 2d fractional fourier transfrom in python

usage:
  frft2d(mat,ax,ay)
  mat: the numberic matrix to be transformed
  ax,ay: the order of transform along x and y axis
  returns the frft spectrum of mat
  
  disfrft(f,a;p)
  f: the discrete signal to be trasformed
  a: the order of transform
  p(optional): the order of approximation, equals to half of the length of f by default
  
 this code is translated from its matlab version. a senpai gave it to me and i dont know its origin.
